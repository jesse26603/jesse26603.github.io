    <h1>Learning HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>
        Learning HTML and CSS wasn't very hard. It was just a <em>lot.</em> CSS has so many properties and values for them that 
        it makes my head spin. HTML is pretty simple (at the level I am working at). Figuring out how to do the design for this
        took way longer than I had expected! I was at least able to get it in the end. There is still quite a lot that I don't
        know, but I am more confident in my abilities than I was before. Plus, I can do some interesting things!
