    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Jesse Bailey-Motts, a 9th Grader in York Tech. I've been in computer programming for 9 weeks as of now.
        I'm not <em>that</em> good at it, but I'm certainly more knowledgable than when I first came in. So far I have learned
        about simple HTML webpage creation, styling in CSS, how to make and use Github repositories, a lot about flow charts,
        and I have made a game in RPG Maker. I even learned about responsive web design (as I was making this webpage!).
        Hopefully I can show off my work for my quarter in computer programming in these pages.
