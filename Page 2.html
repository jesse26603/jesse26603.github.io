    <h1>Github & Repositories</h1>
    <p>
        To get this webpage up for people to see, I had to set up a repository on Github. In programming, github is used
        quite often so that people can work on their porjects at different places. It's not complex or all that impressive,
        but it is important to know how to use Github if you work in programming. Github can also be used to revert changes
        you made back if you made a mistake that broke your work! You can also make a Github page like I did by making a
        repository named [yourusername].github.io and adding an index.html file there.
